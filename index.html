                    <h3>Future</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>The Future of Neural Networks is exiting! Neural Networks
                        are already being used in everyting,
                        from cars to business and even video streaming. With
                        improvements in computer hardware and software there
                        is a clear future for Neural Networks and machine learning. 
                        The pace of development is only just starting we are only just starting 
                        to see whatâ€™s possible with this technology.
                        Each year the machine learning field is getting more complex. With these advances 
                        in this technology this will make other technologies obsolete.
