                    <h2>The 1930's</h2>
                    <p>The idea of machine learning and neural networks first coined in the 1930's-1940's. This started
                        with the first concepts outlined in the 1930's
                        This was because of the recent advances in neuroscience.

                    <p>In the early 1960's the first "k-means" was first used for pulse code modulation by James
                        MacQueen, J. B. (1967). Later in the
                        1970's the Multilayers NN & BP (Backpropagation) algorithms where devloped.

                    <h2>The 1980's</h2>
                    <p>First time a BP (Backpropagation) method was applied to a neural network. This had many
                        predecessors in the 1960's.
                        In 1985 the first Bayesian Network was made. This operates on the Bayes Rule which was invented
                        around 1700.
                        In the late 1980's the Descision Tree method was created for Neural Networks.

                        neural network ).
                        This NetWork was used for image recognition and used techniques such as flipping images to train.
